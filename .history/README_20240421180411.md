## SAM-CDFFNet
![](https://pic3.zhimg.com/100/v2-ed1bcb87855feb9e4b8661eb503b07b2_r.jpg 'SAM-CDFFNet')
+ SAM-CDFFNet backbone from [SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything), some code references [Attention UNet](https://github.com/EdgarLefevre/Attention_Unet_Pytorch), [HRNet](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//github.com/HRNet), [Deeplabv3+](https://github.com/yassouali/pytorch_segmentation/blob/master/models/deeplabv3_plus.py). SAM-CDFFNet achieved the highest accuracy across three open-source remote sensing landslide datasets compared to other contrastive models.
+ The experimental code has been uploaded, and the training and validation of the model can be achieved through the ipynb file in it, and the supporting library information of the code is shown below:

+ [Attention UNet](https://github.com/EdgarLefevre/Attention_Unet_Pytorch). Attention mechanism enhances feature representation by focusing on informative regions during image segmentation.
+ [HRNet](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//github.com/HRNet). High-Resolution Network maintains high-resolution feature maps throughout the network to capture fine details in images effectively.
+ [Deeplabv3+](https://github.com/yassouali/pytorch_segmentation/blob/master/models/deeplabv3_plus.py). DeepLabv3+ utilizes atrous spatial pyramid pooling and decoder module to achieve accurate semantic segmentation with multi-scale features.
